### Short description

This is an ongoing project where I'm constantly searching for ways to optimze it and discover new tools/apply new ideas. Feel free to fork it and play on your own.

The goal is to retrieve real-time data from Kraken and to use ML models to predict crypto prices. The prediciton will be hopefully increased by incorporating sentiment-analysis through a fine-tuned LLM. To ensure reproducibility and scalability the project is also implemented Kubernetes/Docker.

### Tools used

- Kubernetes/Docker
- Python
- SQL
- Kafka
- RisingWave
- Grafana
- Screening of ML Models with Scikit-learn
- Optuna (HP optimization)
- Mlflow
- Rust
- LLMs
